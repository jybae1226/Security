      <h1>3. Security Architecture &amp; Mechanisms</h1>
      <p>
        This page summarizes how 4G and 5G secure subscriber identity, authenticate devices and networks, 
        derive cryptographic keys, and protect signaling and user data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>3.1 4G (LTE) Security</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Authentication (EPS-AKA):</strong> mutual authentication between the User 
          Equipment (UE), the serving base station (eNodeB), and the core network (EPC) using 
          long-term credentials stored in the USIM and in the operator's Home Subscriber Server (HSS).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Key hierarchy:</strong> a master key <em>K</em> is used to derive K<sub>ASME</sub> 
          and then further keys such as KeNB for the radio interface. This limits the impact of 
          key compromise and supports key refresh during mobility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confidentiality and integrity:</strong> standardized algorithms (for example, 
          AES or SNOW 3G based) provide encryption and integrity protection for control-plane 
          signaling and, optionally, for user-plane data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Separation of planes:</strong> different keys and security associations for control 
          and user plane, so that signaling remains protected even if user data is handled by 
          intermediate gateways and tunnels.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>3.2 5G Security Enhancements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>5G-AKA and subscriber identity protection:</strong> the permanent subscriber 
          identifier (SUPI) is never sent in clear over the air. Instead, a concealed identifier (SUCI) 
          is transmitted, protecting users from passive IMSI-catching style attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service-Based Architecture (SBA):</strong> core network functions communicate via 
          HTTP/2 and JSON APIs secured with TLS and modern authentication/authorization mechanisms, 
          aligning mobile network security with common IT security practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Roaming and home control:</strong> the home network has more control over 
          authentication decisions and can better enforce its policies even when the subscriber 
          is served by a visited network.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Network slicing:</strong> logical networks (slices) are isolated and can be 
          configured with different security policies depending on the service (e.g., massive 
          IoT vs. ultra-reliable low-latency communication).
        </li>
      </ul>
