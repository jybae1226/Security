      <h1>4. Known Attacks and Feasibility Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        This page describes representative attacks against 4G and 5G networks and evaluates their 
        feasibility in terms of attacker capabilities, technical complexity, and required budget.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>4.1 Signaling and Protocol-Level Attacks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Downgrade attacks:</strong> an attacker operates a fake base station that forces 
          devices to connect using weaker generations (2G/3G) where encryption or mutual 
          authentication may be absent, enabling eavesdropping or impersonation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attach and tracking area update abuse:</strong> by manipulating attach/TAU 
          procedures, an attacker can cause denial of service for specific subscribers or 
          infer their presence in a given area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fake base stations (IMSI catchers):</strong> devices are tricked into 
          connecting to a rogue station that requests identifiers or exploits missing checks 
          in early connection stages.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>4.2 User Privacy and Location Tracking</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Identifier re-use:</strong> if temporary identifiers (such as GUTI or 5G-GUTI) 
          are not refreshed frequently enough, an attacker can correlate them over time and 
          build movement profiles of a subscriber.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paging analysis:</strong> by monitoring paging messages in a cell and combining 
          them with external triggers (such as sending messages or calls), an attacker can 
          infer whether a specific subscriber is currently in a region.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>4.3 Core Network and SBA Attacks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Exploiting misconfigured APIs:</strong> 5G core network functions expose 
          HTTP-based interfaces. If TLS, certificates, or access control are misconfigured, 
          attackers may gain unauthorized access to signaling or subscriber data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slice isolation failures:</strong> incorrect configuration of network slices 
          can allow one tenant or service to affect the performance or security of another, 
          undermining the isolation promised by network slicing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>4.5 Evaluation Criteria</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Required capabilities:</strong> physical location, access to RF spectrum, or access to operator infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> required knowledge of radio protocols, cryptography, and implementation details.</li>
        <li><strong>Detectability:</strong> whether unusual signaling patterns, RF behavior, or log entries could reveal the attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitigations:</strong> standard-level defenses and deployment-level measures such as monitoring and configuration hardening.</li>
