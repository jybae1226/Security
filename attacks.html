      <h1>3. Known Attacks and Feasibility Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        This page describes major attacks on 4G/LTE and 5G networks and analyzes their feasibility based on
        protocol-level weaknesses, implementation gaps, and attacker resource requirements. The explanations
        draw from real experimental results and academic research, while also considering security improvements
        in modern deployments such as 5G Standalone (SA), gradual 2G/3G sunset in some regions, and updated
        device firmware.

      <h4>3.1 Downgrade and Fake Base-Station Attacks</h4>

      <h6>What it is</h6>
      <p>
        Downgrade attacks and fake base-station impersonation exploit the fact that LTE and 5G Non-Standalone (NSA)
        connection procedures inherit LTE’s security model for initial access. Attackers can broadcast a rogue cell to
        entice nearby devices into connecting to an attacker-controlled LTE/NR cell or falling back to weaker legacy
        technologies (especially 2G, and in some cases 3G), where encryption and integrity protection are significantly
        weaker or absent. In these LTE/NSA settings, certain initial RRC and NAS messages may be processed before full
        authentication and key establishment, so devices can temporarily accept parameters from an attacker-controlled
        base station. In contrast, 5G SA improves initial identity protection using SUCI, making direct large-scale IMSI
        exposure significantly harder.
      </p>

      <h6>Key concepts</h6>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rogue base station:</strong> A fake eNodeB/gNodeB that imitates a real cell to influence, intercept, or manipulate signaling in LTE or 5G NSA.</li>
        <li><strong>Downgrade forcing:</strong> Techniques that cause a device to fall back to 3G/2G networks with weaker security, if legacy RATs are still enabled and allowed by the operator configuration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>How the attack works</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>The attacker broadcasts a strong cell signal, often advertising restricted capabilities (for example, “LTE not supported” or only weakly protected RATs).</li>
        <li>The UE may camp on the rogue cell, release its secure LTE/5G session, and attempt to reconnect using the advertised capabilities.</li>
        <li>In legacy networks, especially on 2G and misconfigured 3G deployments, the attacker can obtain identifiers such as IMSI or observe/manipulate traffic due to weaker or missing protection in the legacy radio stack.</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Feasibility under current security</h6>
      <p>
        These attacks remain feasible primarily in LTE and 5G NSA environments where fallback to older RATs is still allowed and
        2G/3G remain deployed. Even with modern devices, many operators keep legacy technologies enabled for coverage, making
        downgrade a realistic threat in those regions. However, 5G SA with SUCI significantly reduces the risk of permanent identity
        exposure over the air, and in networks that have fully retired 2G/3G the downgrade surface is much smaller. For implementation,
        passive monitoring can be done with very low-cost SDR receivers, but running a fully functional rogue base station that transmits,
        remains synchronized, and correctly handles signaling typically requires higher-end SDR hardware and RF components. This pushes
        the cost beyond simple “under €100” setups, though it is still relatively low for a moderately resourced attacker.
      </p>

      <h4>3.2 Signaling Abuse and Denial-of-Service (DoS)</h4>

      <h6>What it is</h6>
      <p>
        Signaling manipulation targets critical mobility and session management procedures such as Attach, Tracking
        Area Update (TAU), and RRC connection establishment. In LTE and 5G NSA, specific NAS rejection messages
        are defined to be processed before integrity protection is established, in order to avoid signaling loops. This
        design decision creates an attack surface where adversaries can push devices into denial-of-service states or
        force fallback to less secure networks. 5G SA retains similar concepts but benefits from tightened specifications
        and more mature implementations in newer devices and core networks.
      </p>

      <h6>Key concepts</h6>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Downgrade Attack (D1):</strong> Forged “LTE services not allowed” messages that can force UEs to prefer or fall back to 2G/3G where such RATs are still available.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent DoS (D2):</strong> Forged “LTE and non-LTE services not allowed” messages that can lock some devices out of all service until reboot or the expiry of internal recovery timers.</li>
        <li><strong>Control-plane flooding:</strong> Overloading the MME/AMF or RAN by generating excessive attach, TAU, or RRC requests.</li>
      </ul>

          Figure: DoS Attacks Using TAU Reject (D1: Denying LTE Services, D2: Denying All Mobile Services)
        </p>
      </div>

      <h6>How the attack works</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>A rogue base station sends unauthenticated TAU Reject or Attach Reject messages that conform to the standard format but carry malicious cause values.</li>
        <li>The UE, following the LTE specification and its implementation-specific logic, may accept these messages and enter a restricted-service or no-service mode for a defined period.</li>
        <li>Flooding attacks target network nodes directly, consuming signaling and processing resources and degrading service availability for legitimate subscribers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Feasibility under current security</h6>
      <p>
        These attacks require only moderate technical skill and SDR-based infrastructure. Because the standards originally
        allowed certain reject messages to be processed without integrity protection, there is a structural attack surface
        that cannot be removed purely by configuration. However, modern UE firmware and network equipment increasingly
        implement mitigations (for example, ignoring abnormally frequent rejects, applying more conservative timers, or
        cross-checking causes), which can reduce the success rate compared to early LTE deployments. As a result, the
        attacks are still relevant, especially on older or poorly updated devices and networks, but real-world effectiveness
        is more variable than in controlled lab demonstrations.
      </p>

      <h4>3.3 Privacy Attacks via Paging and Identifier Correlation</h4>

      <h6>What it is</h6>
      <p>
        Paging is used to notify devices of incoming services. Although permanent subscriber identities are protected,
        temporary identifiers such as S-TMSI or 5G-GUTI can still leak information through reuse or correlation. By observing
        paging patterns, attackers can determine whether a user is present in a given cell or even track movement across
        areas at a coarse granularity. These attacks typically assume a worst-case scenario where identifier refresh is
        infrequent and paging behavior is relatively stable.
      </p>

      <h6>Key concepts</h6>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifier reuse:</strong> Temporary identifiers that are not refreshed frequently enough enable longer-term tracking across paging areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Paging correlation:</strong> Linking paging bursts with attacker-triggered events (for example, messaging, calls, or application notifications).</li>
        <li><strong>Presence detection:</strong> Determining if the target is currently within the monitored paging area.</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>How the attack works</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>The attacker passively monitors paging channels using inexpensive SDR receivers, without transmitting any radio signals.</li>
        <li>They induce activity for the target (for example, sending messages, calling, or triggering app notifications) to cause predictable paging events.</li>
        <li>Repeated observations allow the attacker to estimate the user’s presence and coarse movement patterns between cells or tracking areas.</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Feasibility under current security</h6>
      <p>
        Paging-based tracking is feasible and difficult to detect because it relies only on passive reception. While 5G protects permanent
        identifiers using SUCI, paging operations themselves remain unavoidable and broadcast by design. In practice, some operators have
        strengthened defenses by shortening TMSI/GUTI refresh intervals, adding randomness, and varying paging behavior, which makes
        long-term correlation attacks harder than in early LTE research setups. In other networks, refresh and paging policies are still more
        static, leaving greater exposure. Therefore, the risks described reflect a conservative worst-case; actual feasibility depends strongly
        on each operator’s configuration, refresh policies, and device behavior.
      </p>

      <h4>3.4 Attacks on the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA)</h4>

      <h6>What it is</h6>
      <p>
        The 5G Core adopts a service-based architecture, replacing many traditional signaling interfaces with HTTP/2-based,
        JSON-encoded APIs on Service-Based Interfaces (SBI) between network functions. This design improves flexibility and
        programmability but expands the attack surface, particularly if authentication, TLS configuration, or access control
        policies are misconfigured. Security components such as SEPP (Security Edge Protection Proxy) are introduced to protect
        inter-operator traffic and roaming interfaces, but internal misconfigurations or weak segmentation can still lead to exposure.
      </p>

      <h6>Key concepts</h6>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SBA exposure:</strong> Misconfigured or overly permissive APIs may allow unauthorized or overly privileged NF calls within the core network.</li>
        <li><strong>Network slicing risks:</strong> Shared physical resources and insufficient isolation can allow faults or compromises in one slice to affect another, if slice isolation is poorly designed or misconfigured.</li>
        <li><strong>IoT-driven signaling storms:</strong> Massive IoT deployments can overload AMF/SMF and RAN resources with simultaneous registration or session establishment attempts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>How the attack works</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>An attacker first gains some form of internal access (for example, via a compromised host, misconfigured firewall, exposed management API, or supply-chain compromise).</li>
        <li>They enumerate network functions and attempt calls to NF services, abusing any gaps in authentication, authorization, or API-level validation.</li>
        <li>Poor TLS configuration or missing/incorrect SEPP enforcement for inter-domain traffic can leak subscriber data or enable manipulation of core signaling across operator boundaries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Feasibility under current security</h6>
      <p>
        SBA vulnerabilities largely depend on operator configuration, vendor implementations, and internal security hygiene. In principle,
        carrier core networks are operated as closed, strongly segmented environments with SEPP, firewalls, and mutual TLS, which creates
        a higher barrier to entry compared to typical internet-facing web systems. Nevertheless, as 5G cores increasingly adopt cloud-native
        and virtualized infrastructures, configuration complexity, automation pipelines, and new management interfaces introduce additional
        risk. SBA exploitation should therefore be viewed as a high-impact but higher-precondition threat that typically requires some form
        of internal, management-plane, or supply-chain compromise before protocol-level vulnerabilities can be abused.
