      <h1>3. Known Attacks and Feasibility Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        This page presents representative attacks against 4G and 5G networks and evaluates how feasible 
        they are in practice based on attacker capabilities, required equipment, complexity, and 
        current countermeasures.

      <h3>3.1 Downgrade and Fake Base-Station Attacks</h3>

      <h4>What it is</h4>
      <p>
        A downgrade attack forces a 4G/5G-capable device to fall back to an older, less secure 
        technology such as 2G or 3G. A fake base station (also known as an IMSI catcher or stingray) 
        impersonates a legitimate cell to make nearby devices connect to it. These attacks exploit 
        weaker security in legacy networks, where encryption or mutual authentication may be absent.
      </p>

      <h4>Key concepts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IMSI catcher:</strong> A rogue base station that attempts to extract permanent identifiers from devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Legacy networks:</strong> Older technologies where encryption or integrity protection may not be enforced.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How the attack works</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The attacker sets up a fake base station advertising strong signal power but only supporting 2G/3G.</li>
        <li>Devices prioritizing connectivity may camp on this rogue station if downgrades are allowed.</li>
        <li>In 2G/3G, the attacker can request the IMSI in plaintext and may intercept or modify traffic if encryption is weak.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Feasibility under current security</h4>
      <p>
        Modern smartphones and operators often restrict 2G/3G fallback, reducing the impact. However, these attacks 
        remain feasible in regions where older networks are still active. 4G/5G security alone cannot fully stop a 
        device from being forced to a weaker technology; mitigation depends on operator policy, device settings, and 
        the gradual deprecation of insecure legacy systems.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Signaling Abuse and Denial-of-Service</h3>

      <h4>What it is</h4>
      <p>
        Signaling-based attacks target attach, tracking area update (TAU), and mobility management procedures. 
        Manipulating these messages can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) for specific subscribers or entire cells.
      </p>

      <h4>Key concepts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TAU (Tracking Area Update):</strong> The process by which a UE notifies the network of movement across areas.</li>
        <li><strong>DoS:</strong> Disrupting service availability for legitimate users.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How the attack works</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>An attacker using a rogue base station or certain privileged interfaces triggers abnormal signaling sequences.</li>
        <li>Repeated attach or TAU requests can overload network elements or cause targeted subscribers to be detached.</li>
        <li>Some flaws allow a UE to be forced into a “no service” state until rebooting or re-attaching.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Feasibility under current security</h4>
      <p>
        Many vulnerabilities found in early LTE deployments have been mitigated through standard updates and vendor patches. 
        However, signaling DoS remains difficult to eliminate entirely because attackers can craft messages that appear 
        protocol-compliant. Detection therefore relies heavily on anomaly analysis and operator monitoring, rather than 
        on cryptographic protection alone.

      <h3>3.3 Privacy Attacks via Paging and Temporary Identifiers</h3>

      <h4>What it is</h4>
      <p>
        Paging is the broadcast mechanism used to locate a device when incoming traffic arrives. By monitoring paging 
        messages and correlating them with external triggers, attackers can infer whether a specific subscriber is present 
        in a particular area.
      </p>

      <h4>Key concepts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Paging message:</strong> Broadcast packet containing a temporary identifier (e.g., S-TMSI, GUTI, 5G-GUTI).</li>
        <li><strong>Linkability:</strong> Ability to correlate repeated identifiers over time and track a subscriber.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How the attack works</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The attacker passively records paging messages using low-cost SDR equipment.</li>
        <li>By triggering events for a target (e.g., messaging, call attempts), they correlate paging timing with their actions.</li>
        <li>Through repeated observations, they can determine presence and movement patterns of the subscriber.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Feasibility under current security</h4>
      <p>
        4G and 5G reduce long-term tracking by frequently refreshing temporary identifiers, but operational choices affect 
        effectiveness. SUCI protects permanent identities but cannot prevent paging-based side-channel attacks entirely, 
        since paging is a fundamental network operation. Thus, these attacks remain moderately feasible with passive equipment.
      </p>

      <h3>3.4 Attacks on 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA)</h3>

      <h4>What it is</h4>
      <p>
        5G core functions communicate via HTTP/2-based APIs. If authentication, TLS, or authorization is misconfigured, 
        attackers may exploit these interfaces to gain unauthorized access or disrupt network functions.
      </p>

      <h4>Key concepts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>API (Application Programming Interface):</strong> REST-like service interface exposed by 5G network functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Misconfiguration:</strong> Weak certificates, improper TLS settings, or overly permissive access control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How the attack works</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The attacker gains a foothold inside the operator’s internal network (compromised host, insider, or misconfigured firewall).</li>
        <li>They scan for exposed service-based interfaces and attempt calls without proper credentials.</li>
        <li>If validation is weak, they may read subscriber data, trigger signaling, or disable functions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Feasibility under current security</h4>
      <p>
        While 5G standards require strong mutual TLS and strict authorization, real-world deployments may deviate due to 
        operational complexity. SBA-related attacks are therefore considered one of the major emerging risks in 5G networks.
