      <h2>Description of security mechanisms, attacks, and feasibility analysis</h2>
      <p>
        This project investigates how 4G and 5G mobile networks are protected, what types of 
        attacks are possible in practice, and how complex and realistic these attacks are for 
        different kinds of adversaries.

      <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Mobile networks have become the main communication infrastructure for billions of users.
        4G/LTE enabled mobile broadband and always-on connectivity, while 5G promises ultra-low latency,
        massive machine-type communication, and support for critical services such as industrial control
        or connected vehicles. As a result, the security of these networks is directly linked to user privacy,
        safety, and even national security.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to provide a clear description of the security mechanisms
        that protect 4G and 5G networks, to summarize known types of attacks against these systems,
        and to analyze the feasibility and complexity of these attacks from the perspective of
        a realistic attacker. The project is based on existing standards and research papers rather
        than on original experiments in an operator network.

      <h3>2. Current State of the Art</h3>
      <p>
        4G/LTE and 5G are specified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which 
        defines detailed security architectures for authentication, key management, and protection 
        of both control-plane and user-plane traffic. Over the last decade, these specifications 
        have evolved to address weaknesses discovered in earlier generations such as 2G and 3G, 
        where encryption was optional and mutual authentication was often missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 4G, the EPS-AKA protocol, a stronger key hierarchy, and mandatory integrity protection 
        already delivered substantial improvements over previous systems. 5G further refines this 
        model by introducing subscriber identity protection on the radio interface, a service-based 
        core network architecture secured with modern web technologies (TLS, OAuth2), and more 
        explicit handling of roaming and inter-operator trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, academic research has shown that even modern systems contain design 
        and implementation flaws. Examples include protocol downgrades to weaker generations, 
        fake base stations that exploit residual weaknesses in the attachment procedures, 
        side-channel based location tracking, and misconfigurations of 5G service-based 
        interfaces. Therefore, the state of the art in mobile network security is a balance 
        between strong standardized mechanisms and practical vulnerabilities in deployments.
