      <h2>Description of security mechanisms, attacks, and feasibility analysis</h2>
      <p>
        This project investigates how 4G and 5G mobile networks are protected, what types of 
        attacks are possible in practice, and how complex and realistic these attacks are for 
        different kinds of adversaries.

      <h1>1. Introduction – What are 4G and 5G and why is security critical?</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        4G (LTE) and 5G are generations of cellular mobile network technology. 
        4G, usually implemented as Long Term Evolution (LTE), introduced high-speed packet-switched data, 
        making mobile broadband, video streaming, and real-time applications practical on smartphones and tablets. 
        4G networks are based on the Evolved Packet System (EPS), which combines the radio access network (E-UTRAN) 
        and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) into an all-IP architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        5G, or Fifth-Generation mobile networks, builds on this by targeting much higher data rates, 
        ultra-low latency, and support for massive numbers of devices. 5G New Radio (NR) and 
        the 5G Core (5GC) are designed to serve three broad categories of services: 
        enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), 
        and massive machine-type communications (mMTC), which includes IoT devices and industrial systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today’s mobile ecosystem, these networks are not only used for personal communication and 
        entertainment but also for critical applications. Examples include connected and autonomous vehicles, 
        industrial control systems, remote healthcare, smart grids, and public safety communication. 
        As more sectors depend on mobile connectivity, any compromise of availability, integrity, 
        or confidentiality in 4G/5G can have economic impact, damage the privacy of millions of users, 
        or even endanger lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security in mobile networks is therefore no longer just about preventing casual eavesdropping on voice calls. 
        It must protect long-term identifiers (such as IMSI or SUPI), signaling integrity, user data, 
        and the operation of complex service platforms. Attackers may range from individual hackers and 
        criminal groups to state-sponsored actors. At the same time, the systems themselves have become more complex: 
        5G introduces cloud-native deployments, a service-based architecture, and network slicing, 
        which all increase the potential attack surface.
