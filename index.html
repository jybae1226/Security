      <h1>1. Introduction – What are 4G and 5G and why is security critical?</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Mobile communication systems have progressed from early analog technologies to 4G LTE and now 5G. 
        This evolution has enabled higher data rates, lower latency, and more advanced applications. 
        Alongside these improvements, the need for stronger and more adaptive security models has grown significantly. 
        This project provides an in-depth comparison of 4G and 5G security mechanisms, 
        supported by both architectural analysis and telecommunications research.
      </p>
      <h4>1.1 What is 4G?</h4>
      <p>
        4G, usually implemented as LTE (Long Term Evolution), is the fourth generation of mobile communication
        technology. It was designed to provide high-speed, fully IP-based mobile broadband and to overcome
        the limitations of 2G and 3G networks, such as limited data rates and separated voice/data infrastructures.
      </p>
      <div class="badge2"><text-medium><strong>Key characteristics of 4G</strong></text-medium></div>
        <ul class="project-bullets">
            <li>Packet-switched voice via VoLTE</li>
            <li>Radio bandwidth from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz</li>
            <li>Data rates ranging from 100 Mbps up to 1 Gbps (LTE-Advanced)</li>
            <li>Latency typically 30–50 ms</li>
            <li>Authentication via EPS-AKA (based on 3GPP AKA)</li>
        </ul>

      <h5>1.1.1 Overall 4G System Architecture</h5>
      <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="images/intro/EPS.png" alt="4G EPS Architecture Diagram" style="max-width: 80%; border-radius: 10px;">
        <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; color:#9ca3af; margin-top: 5px;">
          Figure: Simplified architecture of the 4G Evolved Packet System (EPS)
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        LTE is built around the <strong>Evolved Packet System (EPS)</strong>, which has two main parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>E-UTRAN (Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network)</strong> –
          a network of <strong>eNodeB</strong> base stations that handle wireless transmission
          to and from user equipment, scheduling of radio resources, and handover between cells.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>EPC (Evolved Packet Core)</strong> –
          the core network that manages mobility, user sessions, routing of IP packets,
          and interconnection with external networks such as the public internet.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unlike previous generations, LTE treats both voice and data as IP packets. Voice services are provided
        using <strong>Voice over LTE (VoLTE)</strong>, so there is no separate circuit-switched core.
        This all-IP approach simplifies integration with other IP-based services and networks.
      </p>

      <h5>1.1.2 Functional Components of the EPC</h5>
      <p>
        The EPC is logically divided into several network elements, each responsible for a specific function:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>MME (Mobility Management Entity)</strong> – controls user attachment and detachment,
          tracking area updates, and signaling related to mobility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SGW (Serving Gateway)</strong> – anchors the user-plane traffic while the device moves
          between eNodeBs and forwards data between the radio network and the core.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>PGW (Packet Data Network Gateway)</strong> – provides connectivity to external IP networks,
          applies policy and charging rules, and acts as the IP anchor point for the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>HSS (Home Subscriber Server)</strong> – stores subscriber information, identifiers,
          and parameters used when the user connects to the network.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>1.1.3 Radio Interface and Performance Goals</h5>
      <p>
        On the radio interface, LTE introduces several key technologies to increase capacity and improve user experience:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>OFDM/OFDMA</strong> – the downlink uses orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
          with many narrow subcarriers, which improves robustness against multipath fading and enables efficient
          use of spectrum.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)</strong> – multiple antennas at both the base station
          and the device allow several data streams to be transmitted in parallel, increasing throughput.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexible bandwidths</strong> – LTE can operate with channel bandwidths from 1.4MHz up to
          20MHz per carrier, and LTE-Advanced supports <strong>carrier aggregation</strong> to combine
          several carriers for higher data rates.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With these features, 4G aims for peak downlink data rates in the hundreds of megabits per second and
        typical latencies in the tens of milliseconds. This makes it suitable for applications such as HD video streaming,
        online gaming, and rich mobile web services.
      </p>

      <h4>1.2 What is 5G?</h4>
      <p>
        5G is the fifth generation of mobile networks and is designed not only as a faster evolution of LTE,
        but also as a connectivity platform for very different types of services. Its main goals are extremely
        high data rates, ultra-low latency, massive device connectivity, and high reliability for critical applications.
      </p>
      <div class="badge2"><text-medium><strong>Key characteristics of 5G</strong></text-medium></div>
        <ul class="project-bullets">
            <li>Sub-6 GHz and mmWave spectrum</li>
            <li>Speeds up to 10 Gbps</li>
            <li>Latency as low as 1 ms</li>
            <li>Network slicing and virtualization</li>
            <li>Stronger security through 5G-AKA, SUPI protection, and encrypted SBI interfaces</li>
        </ul>
      <h5>1.2.1 5G New Radio (NR)</h5>
      <p>
        The 5G air interface is called <strong>New Radio (NR)</strong>. It is highly flexible and operates in two
        broad frequency ranges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>FR1 (Frequency Range 1)</strong> – sub-6GHz bands, typically with channel bandwidths
          of up to 100MHz.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>FR2 (Frequency Range 2)</strong> – millimeter-wave bands, defined as 26.5 GHz to 71 GHz, 
          with much wider channel bandwidths (up to 2000 MHz) enabling extreme data rates.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        5G NR combines large bandwidths with advanced antenna technologies such as massive MIMO and beamforming.
        This enables gigabit-class data rates and very low over-the-air latency compared with LTE.
      </p>

      <h5>1.2.2 Deployment Options: NSA and SA</h5>
      <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="images/intro/5G NR Deployment Options.png" alt="5G NR Deployment Options" style="max-width: 50%; border-radius: 10px;">
        <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; color:#9ca3af; margin-top: 5px;">
          Figure: 5G NR Deployment Options – Non-Stand-Alone (NSA) and Stand-Alone (SA)
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        In practical deployments, 5G can be introduced in two main configurations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Stand-Alone (NSA)</strong> – 5G NR is used for the radio interface, but it is anchored
          to the existing 4G EPC. Control signaling still relies on LTE, while high-speed user traffic can be
          carried over NR.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stand-Alone (SA)</strong> – the full 5G system is used, including NR and the new 5G Core (5GC).
          SA enables the complete 5G feature set and is the target architecture for most operators.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Networks are gradually moving from NSA to SA as operators deploy the 5G Core and migrate services.
      </p>

      <h5>1.2.3 5G Core and Service-Based Architecture</h5>
      <p>
        The <strong>5G Core (5GC)</strong> replaces the monolithic EPC with a
        <strong>service-based architecture (SBA)</strong>. Instead of a few large nodes, the core is decomposed
        into many smaller network functions that communicate using standardized APIs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function)</strong> – manages registration, connection handling,
          and mobility procedures for user equipment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SMF (Session Management Function)</strong> – sets up and manages PDU sessions and applies quality-of-service rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>UPF (User Plane Function)</strong> – forwards user traffic and can be placed closer to the edge of
          the network to reduce latency for delay-sensitive services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other functions</strong> – such as subscriber data management and policy control, which can be
          instantiated and scaled independently as software components.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This cloud-native design allows the core to scale horizontally, to be deployed in centralized data centers
        or at the network edge, and to be updated more easily than traditional hardware-centric architectures.
      </p>

      <h5>1.2.4 Network Slicing and Service Types</h5>
      <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="images/intro/Network Slicing.png" alt="Network Slicing" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 10px;">
        <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; color:#9ca3af; margin-top: 5px;">
          Figure: Network Slicing in 5G
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A defining capability of 5G is <strong>network slicing</strong>, where a single physical infrastructure
        is divided into multiple logical networks tailored to specific use cases. Typical service categories are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)</strong> – provides very high throughput and capacity for
          applications such as 4K/8K video streaming and immersive media.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC)</strong> – targets time-critical services
          requiring extremely low latency and high reliability, such as industrial automation or autonomous driving.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)</strong> – connects huge numbers of low-power IoT
          devices like sensors in smart cities and factories.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each slice can have its own performance targets, resource allocation, and policies. This flexibility is one
        of the key reasons why 5G is viewed as a foundational technology for future digital infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h5>1.2.5 Performance Targets</h5>
      <p>
        Compared with LTE, 5G sets much more ambitious performance objectives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Peak data rates of up to tens of gigabits per second in ideal conditions.</li>
        <li>User-experienced data rates several times higher than 4G in dense areas.</li>
        <li>End-to-end latency that can drop below 1ms for specific URLLC services.</li>
        <li>Support for up to one million connected devices per square kilometer in mMTC scenarios.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These targets make 5G suitable not only for traditional mobile broadband but also as a universal connectivity
        platform for industry, transportation, healthcare, and many other domains.
      </p>

      <h5>1.3 Why is security critical in 4G and 5G?</h5>
      <p>
        Security is essential in 4G and 5G because mobile networks have become core digital infrastructure.
        These systems no longer support only voice and basic data—they now handle sensitive personal
        information, financial transactions, real-time services, and large-scale IoT communication.
      </p>
      <ul class="project-bullets">
        <li><strong>They carry sensitive user data</strong> such as authentication tokens, location, and financial information.</li>
        <li><strong>They support critical infrastructure</strong> including healthcare, transportation, and emergency services.</li>
        <li><strong>All-IP operation increases exposure</strong> to traditional internet-based cyberattacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Massive IoT connectivity</strong> creates many new potential attack points.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtualized 5G architectures</strong> introduce risks in APIs, cloud systems, and software supply chains.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because 4G and 5G function as essential communication platforms for society, any security breach can have
        widespread consequences. Strong, adaptable security mechanisms are therefore fundamental to their design.
