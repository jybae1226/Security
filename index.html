          <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Mobile networks have become the main communication infrastructure for billions of users. 
            4G/LTE enabled mobile broadband and always-on connectivity, while 5G promises ultra-low 
            latency, massive machine-type communication, and support for critical services such as 
            industrial control or connected vehicles. As a result, the security of these networks is 
            directly linked to user privacy, safety, and even national security.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project is to provide a clear description of the security mechanisms 
            that protect 4G and 5G networks, to summarize known types of attacks against these systems, 
            and to analyze the feasibility and complexity of these attacks from the perspective of a 
            realistic attacker. The project is based on existing standards and research papers rather 
            than on original experiments in an operator network.

        <!-- 2. State of the art -->
        <section id="state-of-art">
          <h3>2. Current State of the Art</h3>
          <p>
            4G/LTE and 5G are specified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which 
            defines detailed security architectures for authentication, key management, and protection 
            of both control-plane and user-plane traffic. Over the last decade, these specifications 
            have evolved to address weaknesses discovered in earlier generations such as 2G and 3G, 
            where encryption was optional and mutual authentication was often missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 4G, the EPS-AKA protocol, a stronger key hierarchy, and mandatory integrity protection 
            already delivered substantial improvements over previous systems. 5G further refines this 
            model by introducing subscriber identity protection on the radio interface, a service-based 
            core network architecture secured with modern web technologies (TLS, OAuth2), and more 
            explicit handling of roaming and inter-operator trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, academic research has shown that even modern systems contain design 
            and implementation flaws. Examples include protocol downgrades to weaker generations, 
            fake base stations that exploit residual weaknesses in the attachment procedures, 
            side-channel based location tracking, and misconfigurations of 5G service-based 
            interfaces. Therefore, the state of the art in mobile network security is a balance 
            between strong standardized mechanisms and practical vulnerabilities in deployments.

        <!-- 3. Security mechanisms -->
        <section id="mechanisms">
          <h3>3. Security Architecture &amp; Mechanisms</h3>
          <p>
            This section briefly summarizes how 4G and 5G secure subscriber identity, authenticate 
            devices and networks, derive cryptographic keys, and protect signaling and user data.
          </p>

          <h4>3.1 4G (LTE) Security</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Authentication (EPS-AKA):</strong> mutual authentication between the User 
              Equipment (UE), the serving base station (eNodeB), and the core network (EPC) using 
              long-term credentials stored in the USIM and in the operator's Home Subscriber Server (HSS).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Key hierarchy:</strong> a master key <em>K</em> is used to derive K<sub>ASME</sub> 
              and then further keys such as KeNB for the radio interface. This limits the impact of 
              key compromise and supports key refresh during mobility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Confidentiality and integrity:</strong> standardized algorithms (for example, 
              AES or SNOW 3G based) provide encryption and integrity protection for control-plane 
              signaling and, optionally, for user-plane data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Separation of planes:</strong> different keys and security associations for control 
              and user plane, so that signaling remains protected even if user data is handled by 
              intermediate gateways and tunnels.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>3.2 5G Security Enhancements</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>5G-AKA and subscriber identity protection:</strong> the permanent subscriber 
              identifier (SUPI) is never sent in clear over the air. Instead, a concealed identifier (SUCI) 
              is transmitted, protecting users from passive IMSI-catching style attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Service-Based Architecture (SBA):</strong> core network functions communicate via 
              HTTP/2 and JSON APIs secured with TLS and modern authentication/authorization mechanisms, 
              aligning mobile network security with common IT security practices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Roaming and home control:</strong> the home network has more control over 
              authentication decisions and can better enforce its policies even when the subscriber 
              is served by a visited network.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Network slicing:</strong> logical networks (slices) are isolated and can be 
              configured with different security policies depending on the service (e.g., massive 
              IoT vs. ultra-reliable low-latency communication).
            </li>
          </ul>

        <!-- 4. Attacks + Feasibility -->
        <section id="attacks-feasibility">
          <h3>4. Known Attacks and Feasibility Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Even with strong standardized security, practical attacks against 4G and 5G networks 
            remain possible. This section describes representative attacks and evaluates their 
            feasibility in terms of attacker capabilities, technical complexity, and required budget.
          </p>

          <h4>4.1 Signaling and Protocol-Level Attacks</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Downgrade attacks:</strong> an attacker operates a fake base station that forces 
              devices to connect using weaker generations (2G/3G) where encryption or mutual 
              authentication may be absent, enabling eavesdropping or impersonation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Attach and tracking area update abuse:</strong> by manipulating attach/TAU 
              procedures, an attacker can cause denial of service for specific subscribers or 
              infer their presence in a given area.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fake base stations (IMSI catchers):</strong> devices are tricked into 
              connecting to a rogue station that requests identifiers or exploits missing checks 
              in early connection stages.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>4.2 User Privacy and Location Tracking</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Identifier re-use:</strong> if temporary identifiers (such as GUTI or 5G-GUTI) 
              are not refreshed frequently enough, an attacker can correlate them over time and 
              build movement profiles of a subscriber.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Paging analysis:</strong> by monitoring paging messages in a cell and combining 
              them with external triggers (such as sending messages or calls), an attacker can 
              infer whether a specific subscriber is currently in a region.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>4.3 Core Network and SBA Attacks</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Exploiting misconfigured APIs:</strong> 5G core network functions expose 
              HTTP-based interfaces. If TLS, certificates, or access control are misconfigured, 
              attackers may gain unauthorized access to signaling or subscriber data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Slice isolation failures:</strong> incorrect configuration of network slices 
              can allow one tenant or service to affect the performance or security of another, 
              undermining the isolation promised by network slicing.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. Own Opinion and Contribution</h3>
          <p>
            In my opinion, the security design of 4G and especially 5G represents a major improvement 
            over previous generations. The introduction of mutual authentication, stronger key 
            derivation, and subscriber identity protection shows that lessons from past failures 
            have been taken seriously. However, the system is now also more complex: the 5G core 
            relies on many different components and interfaces, which increases the attack surface 
            if they are not configured correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a practical perspective, attacks that require custom RF equipment and detailed 
            protocol knowledge are still mostly limited to motivated adversaries such as security 
            researchers, criminals with technical skills, or state-level actors. On the other hand, 
            misconfigurations of 5G service-based interfaces resemble typical IT security problems 
            and can be exploited with common web security skills. This suggests that mobile network 
            operators need both traditional telecom security expertise and modern IT security 
            practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main contribution of this project is a structured overview that links concrete 
            attacks to the underlying security mechanisms and evaluates their feasibility using 
            simple criteria (required skills, cost, and practicality). This may help students or 
            engineers who are new to the field to quickly understand which threats are mainly of 
            theoretical interest and which ones are realistic in current deployments.

          <h3>6. Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            This project has described the main security mechanisms in 4G and 5G mobile networks, 
            summarized representative attacks from the literature, and analyzed their feasibility. 
            Compared to earlier generations, 4G and 5G offer much stronger protection of subscriber 
            identity and signaling. Nevertheless, several classes of attacks remain possible, 
            especially in the presence of legacy technologies, protocol downgrades, or weak 
            deployments of the 5G core.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future work could include hands-on experiments in a controlled testbed, automated 
            tools for detecting misconfigurations in service-based interfaces, and better 
            visualization of the security properties of different network slices. Overall, 
            mobile network security is a moving target, and continuous collaboration between 
            standardization bodies, operators, and the research community is necessary to keep 
            4G and 5G networks trustworthy.
