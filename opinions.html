      <h1>4. My Own Opinion</h1>

      <h6>4.1 Is 5G “more secure” than 4G in practice?</h6>
      <p>
        From a protocol and architectural standpoint, I believe that the security design of 5G is clearly 
        stronger than that of 4G. Mechanisms such as 5G-AKA / EAP-AKA′, SUPI/SUCI-based subscriber identity protection, 
        and SBA security through SEPP reflect how lessons from previous generations have been incorporated 
        into the standard. In my view, mutual authentication, improved key binding to serving networks, 
        and encrypted subscriber identifiers all raise the bar significantly for many traditional attack scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I do not think the question of whether 5G is always more secure for end users today 
        can be answered simply. Many 5G NSA (Non-Stand-Alone) deployments still rely on 4G attach and 
        mobility procedures, including pre-authentication signaling and fallback to legacy technologies. 
        As long as 2G and 3G remain available and enabled on devices, I consider downgrade attacks and 
        fake base-station threats to remain realistically achievable. Optional protections such as 
        user-plane integrity are also not consistently enabled in operational networks due to performance or 
        operational constraints, which further limits practical security.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, while I view 5G as providing meaningful architectural improvements, 
        I think the actual security experienced by users depends far more on legacy coexistence, 
        configuration choices, and implementation quality than on the standard itself.

        <h1>5. Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          This project has examined security in 4G and 5G mobile networks from three main
          perspectives: the security architecture and mechanisms, the concrete attacks that
          target these mechanisms, and the feasibility of those attacks in real deployments.
          EPS-AKA, hierarchical key management, NAS/RRC protection, and NDS/IPsec form the
          foundation of 4G security, while 5G extends this with 5G-AKA/EAP-AKA′, SUPI/SUCI,
          deeper key hierarchies, SBA security, and SEPP for inter-operator protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The analysis of attacks shows that downgrade and fake base-station attacks, signaling
          abuse, paging-based tracking, SBA exploitation, and IoT-driven signaling storms all
          remain relevant, but with very different preconditions and impacts. Low-cost SDRs are
          sufficient for passive monitoring and some active attacks, whereas exploiting SBA and
          slicing generally requires an internal foothold and advanced skills. This leads to
          several overarching conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, security has improved significantly from 4G to 5G, especially in terms of
          subscriber identity protection and binding of keys to serving networks. However,
          as long as legacy technologies and downgrade paths are present, many of the classic
          weaknesses do not disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the main issues are rarely failures of the cryptographic algorithms themselves;
          they are more often related to partial deployment of available protections, permissive 
          fallback policies, and configuration errors in complex, cloud-native cores.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the move to SBA and virtualization brings mobile core security closer to
          mainstream IT and cloud security. Telecom security expertise must now be combined with
          robust practices for API security, certificate management, segmentation, and automated
          deployment pipelines.
        <p>
          In conclusion, secure 5G is technically achievable with the mechanisms already defined
          in current standards. Achieving it in practice depends on retiring or strictly limiting
          insecure legacy technologies, fully activating integrity and confidentiality protections,
          hardening SBA and slicing, and maintaining continuous monitoring and updating of both
          network and device software. Only by addressing both protocol design and day-to-day
          operational security can 4G and 5G networks deliver the level of trust expected from
          modern critical communications infrastructure.
