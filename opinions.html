      <h1>4. My Own Opinion</h1>
      <p>
        In my opinion, the security design of 4G and especially 5G represents a major improvement 
        over previous generations. The introduction of mutual authentication, stronger key 
        derivation, and subscriber identity protection shows that lessons from past failures 
        have been taken seriously. However, the system is now also more complex: the 5G core 
        relies on many different components and interfaces, which increases the attack surface 
        if they are not configured correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a practical perspective, attacks that require custom RF equipment and detailed 
        protocol knowledge are still mostly limited to motivated adversaries such as security 
        researchers, criminals with technical skills, or state-level actors. On the other hand, 
        misconfigurations of 5G service-based interfaces resemble typical IT security problems 
        and can be exploited with common web security skills. This suggests that mobile network 
        operators need both traditional telecom security expertise and modern IT security 
        practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main contribution of this project is a structured overview that links concrete 
        attacks to the underlying security mechanisms and evaluates their feasibility using 
        simple criteria (required skills, cost, and practicality). This may help students or 
        engineers who are new to the field to quickly understand which threats are mainly of 
        theoretical interest and which ones are realistic in current deployments.

        <h1>5. Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          This project has described the main security mechanisms in 4G and 5G mobile networks, 
          summarized representative attacks, and analyzed their feasibility. 
          Compared to earlier generations, 4G and 5G offer much stronger protection of subscriber 
          identity and signaling. Nevertheless, several classes of attacks remain possible, 
          especially in the presence of legacy technologies, protocol downgrades, or weak 
          deployments of the 5G core.
        </p>
        <p>
          Future work could include hands-on experiments in a controlled testbed, automated 
          tools for detecting misconfigurations in service-based interfaces, and better 
          visualization of the security properties of different network slices. Overall, 
          mobile network security is a moving target, and continuous collaboration between 
          standardization bodies, operators, and the research community is necessary to keep 
          4G and 5G networks trustworthy.
