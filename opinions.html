      <h1>4. My Own Opinion</h1>

      <h2>4.1 Is 5G “more secure” than 4G in practice?</h2>
      <p>
        From a protocol and architecture perspective, the security design of 5G is clearly
        stronger than that of 4G. Mechanisms such as 5G-AKA / EAP-AKA′, SUPI/SUCI for identity
        protection, and service-based architecture (SBA) security with SEPP show that lessons
        from earlier generations have been incorporated into the standard. Mutual authentication,
        improved key binding to serving networks, and encrypted subscriber identifiers
        significantly raise the bar for many classical attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if the question is whether 5G deployments today are always safer for end users,
        the answer is more nuanced. Many 5G Non-Stand-Alone (NSA) deployments still inherit 4G
        attach and mobility behavior, including pre-authentication signaling and fallback to
        legacy technologies. As long as 2G/3G remain available and enabled, downgrade paths and
        fake base-station attacks remain realistic in those regions. Optional protections such as
        user-plane integrity are also not consistently activated in real networks due to
        performance or operational considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, architecturally 5G represents a meaningful security improvement, but the
        effective security level in practice is heavily constrained by legacy coexistence,
        configuration choices, and implementation quality rather than by the standard itself.
      </p>

      <h2>4.2 Where the real risks lie today</h2>
      <p>
        Looking at the mechanisms and attacks discussed earlier, the most relevant current risks
        can be grouped into several areas:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legacy coexistence and downgrade paths.</strong>
        As long as 2G/3G networks are still deployed and allowed as fallback options, attackers
        can often sidestep much of the security hardening in LTE and 5G by forcing devices onto
        weaker technologies. In this sense, decisions about retiring older RATs are almost as
        important as introducing new security features in 5G.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Signaling behavior and implementation details.</strong>
        Design choices such as processing some NAS reject messages before integrity protection
        create structural weaknesses that cannot be fully removed by configuration alone. How
        devices implement timers, how often temporary identifiers are refreshed, and how strictly
        networks validate signaling causes all have a major influence on real-world exploitability.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Core-network complexity and cloud-native 5G.</strong>
        With SBA, NFV, and network slicing, 5G core networks now resemble large cloud systems
        with many microservices and APIs. Even if telecom-specific protocols are sound,
        misconfigurations, weak segmentation, certificate management issues, and exposed
        management interfaces can introduce vulnerabilities that are closer to traditional IT
        security problems than to classical radio attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Massive IoT and signaling storms.</strong>
        The growth of mMTC means that huge numbers of devices can generate RRC and NAS signaling.
        Faulty firmware, compromised IoT devices, or poorly designed applications can unintentionally
        create large-scale signaling storms, which from the network’s perspective are not very
        different from deliberate DDoS attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the main risks are not catastrophic cryptographic failures but rather
        operational and ecosystem issues: legacy interworking, incomplete deployment of existing
        protections, and the complexity of cloud-native 5G cores.
      </p>

      <h2>4.3 Recommended security priorities</h2>
      <p>
        If I had to prioritize concrete actions for different stakeholders, they would be:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mobile network operators:</strong> plan and execute the sunset of 2G/3G where
        possible, or at least restrict fallback; enable integrity protection where performance
        allows; harden SBA with strict mutual TLS, strong NF authentication and authorization,
        and careful API exposure; and review paging and identifier-refresh policies from a
        privacy perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Device and chipset vendors:</strong> implement conservative handling of
        unprotected signaling (especially reject and downgrade messages), expose security-relevant
        options such as disabling 2G or preferring 5G SA to advanced users and enterprise admins,
        and ensure that protocol-level mitigations can actually be delivered through robust
        update mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Regulators and standardization bodies:</strong> encourage or mandate the
        deprecation of insecure legacy technologies where feasible, define minimum requirements
        for paging-related privacy and SBA hardening, and promote transparency about the security
        posture of commercial networks, especially those used for critical infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Security researchers:</strong> gradually shift focus from purely radio-protocol
        exploits toward SBA, slicing, orchestration, and cloud infrastructure, and perform
        longitudinal measurements of how quickly best practices such as SUCI use, 5G SA
        deployment, and GUTI refresh policies are adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, my view is that 4G and 5G are not fundamentally broken at the cryptographic
        level. The decisive factor is how well the mechanisms are deployed and operated in
        real networks.
      </p>

        <h1>5. Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          This project has examined security in 4G and 5G mobile networks from three main
          perspectives: the security architecture and mechanisms, the concrete attacks that
          target these mechanisms, and the feasibility of those attacks in real deployments.
          EPS-AKA, hierarchical key management, NAS/RRC protection, and NDS/IPsec form the
          foundation of 4G security, while 5G extends this with 5G-AKA/EAP-AKA′, SUPI/SUCI,
          deeper key hierarchies, SBA security, and SEPP for inter-operator protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The analysis of attacks shows that downgrade and fake base-station attacks, signaling
          abuse, paging-based tracking, SBA exploitation, and IoT-driven signaling storms all
          remain relevant, but with very different preconditions and impacts. Low-cost SDRs are
          sufficient for passive monitoring and some active attacks, whereas exploiting SBA and
          slicing generally requires an internal foothold and advanced skills. This leads to
          several overarching conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, security has improved significantly from 4G to 5G, especially in terms of
          subscriber identity protection and binding of keys to serving networks. However,
          as long as legacy technologies and downgrade paths are present, many of the classic
          weaknesses do not disappear. Second, the main issues are rarely failures of the
          cryptographic algorithms themselves; they are more often related to partial deployment
          of available protections, permissive fallback policies, and configuration errors in
          complex, cloud-native cores.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the move to SBA and virtualization brings mobile core security closer to
          mainstream IT and cloud security. Telecom security expertise must now be combined with
          robust practices for API security, certificate management, segmentation, and automated
          deployment pipelines. Risk evaluation becomes highly deployment-specific: the same
          theoretical attack may be trivial in one operator’s network and practically infeasible
          in another, depending on RAT sunset policies, identifier-refresh strategies, and
          implementation maturity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, secure 5G is technically achievable with the mechanisms already defined
          in current standards. Achieving it in practice depends on retiring or strictly limiting
          insecure legacy technologies, fully activating integrity and confidentiality protections,
          hardening SBA and slicing, and maintaining continuous monitoring and updating of both
          network and device software. Only by addressing both protocol design and day-to-day
          operational security can 4G and 5G networks deliver the level of trust expected from
          modern critical communications infrastructure.
